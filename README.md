## Comprehensive Time Tracking with ManicTime

ManicTime is a professional time-tracking software designed to monitor and analyze how users allocate their time on a Windows computer. It is particularly beneficial for freelancers, remote workers, and anyone interested in enhancing productivity or needing to detail their work hours precisely.

## Features of ManicTime Pro Full:

Automatic tracking
ManicTime automatically records your computer usage. It remembers which apps youâ€™ve used and for how long. It will also remember which web sites youâ€™ve visited and which documents youâ€™ve worked on. All this data will help you keep track of your work hours.

Privacy
Data, which ManicTime collects, is stored on your machine and not sent anywhere. It is not shared with us or any third party and exists only on your machine.

Offline work
ManicTime is not a cloud based service, instead it uses a local datastore, so all recorded data will be kept on your machine. This also means that it will work the same with or without internet connection.

Accurate timekeeping
All the data ManicTime collects will be presented in a easy to understand graphical interface. This will help you to quickly figure out when you went to lunch and when youâ€™ve switched tasks. From now on, your logged hours will be accurate and simple to track.

Easy timesheets
From the hours you logged its easy to create almost any kind of report. Once you create the report, you can easily copy it to Excel or some other tool and create an invoice there.
